# pantry-js-backend
This is the backend repository for the JavaScript project at Flatiron School.

It is a single page web application driven by asyncrounous Javascript utilizing this backend Rails API (Frontend repository here: https://github.com/mcrooks65/pantry-js-frontend)

## Description
Pantry-js is an application meant help track and organize the food in your pantry.  Current version is only a minimum viable product for the JavaScript project at Flatiron School, but other features could be implemented such as grocery-cart and recipe modules which would enhance the utility of the application greatly.

## Installation
!Improtant! This is only the backend of this application and it will not give you access to the pantry application itself. Make sure to set up this Rails server before proceeding to use the frontend application at https://github.com/mcrooks65/pantry-js-frontend.

Once this backend Rails server is running, open index.html (from frontend repo) in your browser of choice to access the pantry web application.
